# Sentiment-Analysis
Project Title: Sentiment Analysis
Objective: To analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of textual data.
Dataset: Gather and preprocess a diverse dataset containing labeled text samples.
Data Cleaning: Remove noise, special characters, and handle missing values in the dataset.
Text Tokenization: Convert text into tokens (words, phrases) for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Utilize techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings to represent text data.
Model Selection: Choose appropriate ML & DL algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models like LSTM.
Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets and train the selected model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model by fine-tuning hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.
Interpretation: Analyze the model's predictions and investigate its misclassifications.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a web application or API for real-time sentiment analysis.
User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface to input text and display sentiment results.
Monitoring: Implement monitoring to track the model's performance in production.
Feedback Loop: Incorporate user feedback to continually improve the model's accuracy and generalization.
Documentation: Prepare detailed documentation on data preprocessing, model architecture, and deployment steps.
Ethics: Consider ethical implications and potential bias in the dataset and model predictions.
