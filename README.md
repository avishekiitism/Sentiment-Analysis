# Sentiment-Analysis
Project Title: Sentiment Analysis 

Objective: To analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of textual data.

Dataset: Gather and preprocess a diverse dataset containing labeled text samples.

Data Cleaning: Remove noise, special characters, and handle missing values in the dataset.

Text Tokenization: Convert text into tokens (words, phrases) for analysis.

Feature Extraction: Utilize techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings to represent text data.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate ML & DL algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models like LSTM.

Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets and train the selected model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model by fine-tuning hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.

Interpretation: Analyze the model's predictions and investigate its misclassifications.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a web application or API for real-time sentiment analysis.

User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface to input text and display sentiment results.

Monitoring: Implement monitoring to track the model's performance in production.

Feedback Loop: Incorporate user feedback to continually improve the model's accuracy and generalization.

Documentation: Prepare detailed documentation on data preprocessing, model architecture, and deployment steps.

Ethics: Consider ethical implications and potential bias in the dataset and model predictions.
